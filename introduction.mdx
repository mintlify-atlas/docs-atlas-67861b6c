## Why BMS POS?

**Separation of concerns** - Clean architecture with distinct frontend, backend, and database layers

**Type safety** - TypeScript on the frontend and C# on the backend eliminate entire classes of runtime errors

**Hot reload** - Vite provides instant feedback during development with sub-second refresh times

**Structured logging** - Serilog outputs JSON logs for easy analysis and monitoring

**Real-time updates** - Supabase enables live data synchronization across multiple terminals

**Cross-platform** - Electron enables Windows, macOS, and Linux support from a single codebase

**Offline-ready** - Desktop application works without internet when API is hosted locally

## Default credentials

The system automatically creates a default manager account on first run:

- **Employee ID**: `0001`
- **PIN**: `1234`
- **Role**: Manager

<Warning>
  Change the default PIN immediately after your first login for security purposes.
