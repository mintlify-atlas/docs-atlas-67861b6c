    **Method 3: Scan barcodes**
    - Connect a USB barcode scanner (optional)
    - Scan product barcodes to instantly add them to the cart

    <Note>
      Products display stock levels. Items marked **OUT OF STOCK** cannot be added, and **LOW STOCK** items show a warning.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the cart">
    On the right side, review your cart:
    - Each line shows: Product name, price per unit, quantity, and line total
    - Click the quantity to edit it manually
    - Click the **×** button to remove an item
    - The bottom shows:
      - **Subtotal**: Total before tax
      - **Sales Tax**: Automatically calculated (default 10%)
      - **Total**: Final amount due

    <Tip>
      The tax rate can be configured in **Settings → Tax Settings**. You can also enable secondary taxes or tax exemptions.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Process payment">
    1. Click the green **Pay** button at the bottom right
    2. A payment modal appears showing the order summary
    3. Select a payment method from the dropdown:

    4. Enter the amount paid (use the on-screen keyboard for touch displays)
    5. The system automatically calculates change
    6. Click **Complete Payment** when ready

    <Note>
      **Manager Discounts**: Managers can apply discounts (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%) before payment. If system settings require manager approval, cashiers must enter a manager PIN.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="View the receipt">
    After completing payment:
    - A receipt preview appears (if enabled in system settings)
    - Review the transaction details
    - Choose to:
      - **Print Receipt** - Send to connected thermal printer
      - **Skip Print** - Complete without printing
      - **Back** - Return to payment screen

    The transaction is saved with a unique ID format: `TXN-YYYYMMDD-XXXXXXXX`

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Login fails with 'Employee not found'">
    - Verify you entered `0001` (four digits with leading zeros)
    - Check that the API is running on `http://localhost:5002`
    - Test API health: `curl http://localhost:5002/health`
    - Review API logs in the terminal
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Products don't appear in the POS">
    - Ensure products exist in the database (check **Inventory** section)
    - Verify products are marked as **Active** (inactive products are hidden)
    - Check the browser console for API errors (F12)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Payment button is disabled">
    - Cart must contain at least one item
    - Amount paid must be greater than or equal to the total
    - Check for insufficient stock errors
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Barcode scanner not working">
    - Ensure scanner is in USB HID keyboard mode

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Session management

The BMS POS includes automatic session management:

- **Auto-logout**: Sessions expire after inactivity (configurable)
- **Session extension**: Activity extends the session automatically
- **Secure PINs**: All PINs are hashed using BCrypt for security
- **Activity logging**: All actions are logged with user, timestamp, and IP

(src: `src/frontend/utils/SessionManager.ts`)
