    If not found locally, the system automatically queries the UPC database.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Fill in product details">
    Complete required fields:
    - **Product name** - What customers will see
    - **Quantity** - Initial stock count
    - **Cost price** - Your purchase cost
    - **Selling price** - Retail price to customers
    - **Low stock alert** - Reorder threshold (default: 5)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add optional information">
    Enhance product details:

    - **Brand** - Useful for filtering and search
    - **Category** - Select from pre-configured categories
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review image preview">
    If UPC database found an image, it will appear in the preview. The image will be saved with the product.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click 'Add'">
    Save the new product to the catalog. It will immediately appear in the POS.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### API endpoint

**Create product**: `POST /api/products`

```json
{
  "barcode": "012345678912",
  "name": "Coca-Cola",
  "variant": "500ml",
  "brand": "Coca-Cola Company",
  "category": "Beverages",
  "stockQuantity": 100,
  "minStockLevel": 20,
  "cost": 0.75,
  "price": 1.50,
  "unit": "pcs",
  "isActive": true,
  "imageUrl": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
}
```

## Editing products

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the product">
    Use search or scroll to locate the product in the grid.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click 'Edit' or select product">
    Hover over the product card and click "Edit", or click the product to view details then click "Edit Product".
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Modify fields">
    Update any field except the barcode. Changes to stock quantity are tracked in user activity logs.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click 'Save Changes'">
    The product is updated and changes are logged. The system tracks:
    - What changed (field by field)
    - Who made the change (from session)
    - When the change occurred
    - Significant price changes (>20%) are flagged
  </Step>
</Steps>

### API endpoint

**Update product**: `PUT /api/products/{id}`

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "barcode": "012345678912",
  "name": "Coca-Cola",
  "variant": "500ml",
  "brand": "Coca-Cola Company",
  "category": "Beverages",
  "stockQuantity": 85,
  "minStockLevel": 20,
  "cost": 0.75,
  "price": 1.50,
  "unit": "pcs",
  "isActive": true,
  "imageUrl": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  "createdDate": "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "lastUpdated": "2026-02-28T14:25:00Z"
}
```

## Deleting products

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select product">
    Click the product to load it into the edit form.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click 'Delete'">
    A confirmation dialog appears.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm deletion">
    Click "OK" to permanently delete the product from the database. This action cannot be undone.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Permanent deletion**: Products are hard-deleted from the database, not just marked inactive. Historical sales records will still reference the product by name/barcode, but the product itself is removed.
</Warning>

### API endpoint

**Delete product**: `DELETE /api/products/{id}`

## Barcode scanning

### Scanner detection

The system automatically detects barcode scanner input:

1. Scanner sends rapid keystrokes (barcode digits)
2. Scanner sends Enter key at the end
3. System buffers keystrokes within 100ms window
4. When buffer reaches ≥5 characters, barcode search is triggered

**Compatible scanners**: Any USB barcode scanner configured in USB-HID keyboard mode.

### Barcode search workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Scan barcode">
    Use barcode scanner to input product barcode into the barcode field.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Local database search">
    System searches for product: `GET /api/products/barcode/{barcode}`
    
    If found, product is loaded into the edit form for viewing/editing.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="UPC database fallback">
    If not found locally, system queries UPC Item Database API:
    
    `GET https://api.upcitemdb.com/prod/trial/lookup?upc={barcode}`
    
    If found, product information is pre-filled in the add form.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Manual entry">
    If not found in either database, barcode remains in the field for manual product entry.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## UPC database integration

### Automatic product information

When a barcode is not found locally, the system queries the UPC Item Database to retrieve:

- **Product title** → Name
- **Brand name** → Brand
- **Product size** → Variant
- **Category** → Category
- **Product images** → Image URL

### Image selection logic

The system intelligently selects product images:

1. **Filter reliable sources** - Prefers images from:
   - walmart.com
   - amazon.com
   - target.com
   - walgreens.com

2. **Exclude broken URLs** - Skips URLs containing:
   - `spin_prod_ec_` (known placeholder images)
   - `rpx/i/s/i/spin` (broken image patterns)

3. **Prefer HTTPS** - Uses secure image URLs when available

4. **Fallback** - Uses first available HTTPS image if no reliable sources found

### UPC database limitations

- **Trial API** - Free tier has rate limits (100 requests/day)
- **Coverage** - Not all barcodes are in the database
- **Accuracy** - Product information may be incomplete or outdated
- **Images** - Some image URLs may expire or break over time

<Tip>
  Consider upgrading to UPC Item Database paid plan for higher rate limits and better coverage in production environments.
</Tip>

## Stock level management

### Current stock

The "Quantity" field shows current available stock. This number:
- Decreases automatically when sales are processed
- Increases automatically when returns are restocked
- Can be manually adjusted in the edit form

### Low stock alerts

The "Low Stock Alert" threshold triggers visual warnings when:

```javascript
stockQuantity <= minStockLevel
```

Products below this threshold are highlighted in:
- Inventory grid (orange text)
- POS product grid (orange "LOW STOCK" banner)
- Dashboard low stock report

### Stock adjustments

To manually adjust stock:

1. Edit the product
2. Change the "Quantity" field
3. Click "Save Changes"

The adjustment is logged with:
- User who made the change
- Old quantity → New quantity
- Change amount (+/-)
- Timestamp

### API endpoint

**Update stock**: `PUT /api/products/{id}/stock`

```json
{
  "newQuantity": 75,
  "reason": "Physical inventory count"
}
```

## Low stock products

View all products below minimum stock level:

**API endpoint**: `GET /api/products/low-stock`

**Response**:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "Coca-Cola 500ml",
    "barcode": "012345678912",
    "stockQuantity": 8,
    "minStockLevel": 20,
    "price": 1.50
  }
]
```

This endpoint is used by:
- Dashboard alerts
- Inventory reports
- Reorder notifications

## Category management

### Configuring categories

Product categories are configured in:

**System Settings → Product Categories**

Enter comma-separated category names:
```
Beverages, Snacks, Dairy, Frozen Foods, Household, Personal Care
```

### Using categories

**In inventory management**:
- Select category from dropdown when adding/editing products
- Filter product grid by category

**In POS**:
- Search products by category
- Filter product grid by category (future enhancement)

**In reports**:
- Group sales by product category
- Analyze category performance

## Product images

### Image sources

1. **UPC Database** - Automatically downloaded during barcode search
2. **Manual URL** - Enter image URL directly (not currently exposed in UI)
3. **Upload** - Not yet implemented

### Image display

**In inventory grid**:
- Thumbnail size: 72px height
- Fallback: "Image" placeholder text
- Object-fit: contain (preserves aspect ratio)

**In POS grid**:
- Thumbnail size: 88px height
- Fallback: "Image" placeholder text
- Lazy loading for performance

**In product detail modal**:
- Full size: 192px height
- Fallback: "No Image Available" message

### Image URL validation

The system performs client-side validation:
- Tests image loading with `onLoad` event
- Falls back to placeholder on `onError` event
- Logs loading failures to console for debugging

## API endpoints

Complete inventory management API:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `/api/products` | GET | List all active products |
| `/api/products/{id}` | GET | Get single product details |
| `/api/products/barcode/{barcode}` | GET | Search by barcode |
| `/api/products/low-stock` | GET | List low stock products |
| `/api/products` | POST | Create new product |
| `/api/products/{id}` | PUT | Update product |
| `/api/products/{id}/stock` | PUT | Adjust stock quantity |
| `/api/products/{id}` | DELETE | Delete product |

## Inventory reports

### Stock value calculation

```javascript
totalInventoryValue = Σ(product.stockQuantity × product.cost)
```

### Potential revenue

```javascript
potentialRevenue = Σ(product.stockQuantity × product.price)
```

### Profit margin per product

```javascript
margin = ((price - cost) / price) × 100
```

Example: ($1.50 - $0.75) / $1.50 = 50% margin
