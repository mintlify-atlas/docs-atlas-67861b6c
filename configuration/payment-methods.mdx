---

Payment methods determine which payment options are available during checkout. Configure accepted payment types, set defaults, and use quick presets for common configurations.

## Overview

BMS POS supports three primary payment method categories:

- **Cash** - Physical currency payments
- **Card** - Credit and debit card payments
- **ETF/Digital** - Electronic fund transfers and digital wallets

You can enable any combination of these methods based on your business needs and available payment processing infrastructure.

## Configuring payment methods

Navigate to **Manager Dashboard** → **System Settings** → **Payment Methods** to configure payment options.

<ParamField path="availablePaymentMethods" type="string" default="Cash,Card,ETF/Digital">
  Comma-separated list of enabled payment methods
  
  **Format:** Enter payment methods separated by commas, exactly as you want them to appear in the POS interface.
  
  Examples:
  - `Cash,Card,ETF/Digital` - All methods enabled
  - `Cash` - Cash only
  - `Card,ETF/Digital` - Cashless only
  - `Cash,Card` - Traditional methods only
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="defaultPaymentMethod" type="string" default="Cash">
  Payment method selected by default at checkout
  
  Must be one of the available payment methods configured above. This method is pre-selected when the cashier navigates to the payment screen, saving time for the most common payment type.
</ParamField>

<Note>
  The default payment method must exist in the available payment methods list. If you remove the default method, remember to set a new default.
</Note>

5. Customer completes payment
6. Receipt is printed/emailed

**Standard:**
```
Cash,Card,ETF/Digital
```

**Custom examples:**
```
Cash,Credit Card,Mobile Payment

Cash Only,Card Payment,Digital Wallet
```

<Warning>
  Keep payment method names consistent and clear. Avoid using special characters or overly long names that may not display properly on receipts.
</Warning>

## Payment method reporting

Payment methods are tracked in sales reports:

- **Daily sales by payment method** - See which methods are most popular
- **Transaction counts** - Track number of transactions per method
- **Payment reconciliation** - Match physical cash to cash sales
- **Digital payment tracking** - Monitor card and ETF transaction volumes

## Security considerations

### Cash handling

- Train staff on proper cash handling procedures
- Use cash drops for large bills during busy periods
- Perform regular cash counts and reconciliation
- Secure cash drawer when not in use

### Card and digital payments

- Use PCI-compliant payment terminals
- Never store full card numbers
- Enable transaction receipts for dispute resolution
- Monitor for suspicious transaction patterns

## API configuration

Payment methods are configured through the System Settings API:

```http
POST /api/system-settings
```

**Example request:**

```json
{
  "availablePaymentMethods": "Cash,Card,ETF/Digital",
  "defaultPaymentMethod": "Cash"
}
```

**Validation rules:**
- `availablePaymentMethods` cannot be empty
- `defaultPaymentMethod` must exist in `availablePaymentMethods`
- Payment method names are case-sensitive
