The physical inventory counting feature helps you verify actual stock levels against system records and make necessary adjustments.

## Overview

Inventory counting allows you to:

- Perform physical counts of products
- Compare actual counts with system stock levels
- Automatically calculate discrepancies
- Create stock adjustments to reconcile differences
- Maintain accurate inventory records

## Performing a physical count

To conduct an inventory count:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access physical counting">
    Navigate to **Advanced Inventory Management** and select the **Physical Counting** tab.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select a product">
    Use the search field to find the product by name or barcode. You can scan barcodes or type to search.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="View system stock">
    Once selected, the system displays the current stock level recorded in the database.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter actual count">
    Input the actual quantity counted during the physical inventory check.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review the difference">
    The system automatically calculates and displays:
    - System stock quantity
    - Actual count quantity
    - Difference (positive or negative)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Apply the count">
    Click **Apply Count** to create a stock adjustment matching the difference.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Count reconciliation

When you apply a physical count, the system:

1. Calculates the difference between system and actual count
2. Creates a stock adjustment with type "CORRECTION"
3. Applies the adjustment reason: "Physical count adjustment"
4. Updates the product's stock quantity to match the actual count
5. Logs the activity for audit purposes

## Types of inventory counts

While the system supports general physical counting, you can organize counts by:

### Full inventory count

Count all products in your inventory:
- Typically performed annually or semi-annually
- Requires significant time and resources
- Provides complete inventory verification
- Best done when business is closed

### Cycle counting

Count a subset of inventory on a rotating schedule:
- Count high-value items more frequently
- Count fast-moving items regularly
- Distribute counting workload over time
- Reduces need for full shutdowns

### Spot counting

Count specific products as needed:
- Verify items with suspected discrepancies
- Check products before restocking
- Investigate customer complaints
- Random audits for quality control

### Annual count

Comprehensive year-end inventory:
- Required for financial reporting
- Complete verification of all stock
- Reconcile all discrepancies
- Document for accounting purposes

## Handling count discrepancies

When actual counts don't match system records:

### Positive differences (more stock than recorded)

Possible causes:
- Unrecorded deliveries
- Return processing errors
- Data entry mistakes
- Found inventory

The system creates a positive adjustment to increase stock.

### Negative differences (less stock than recorded)

Possible causes:
- Theft or shrinkage
- Damage not recorded
- Sales processing errors
- Misplaced inventory

The system creates a negative adjustment to decrease stock.

## Count workflow

The physical counting process in InventoryManagement.tsx:760-869:

1. **Product selection**: Search and select product to count
2. **System stock display**: Shows current recorded quantity
3. **Actual count entry**: Enter physically counted quantity
4. **Difference calculation**: Automatically computed in real-time
5. **Adjustment creation**: Creates CORRECTION type adjustment
6. **Stock update**: Updates product quantity to match count
7. **Activity logging**: Records the adjustment for audit trail

## Best practices for inventory counts

### Before counting

<Steps>
  <Step title="Schedule appropriately">
    Choose times with minimal activity, ideally when the store is closed.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Organize inventory">
    Ensure products are properly arranged and labeled.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Prepare tools">
    Have barcode scanners, count sheets, and the POS system ready.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Assign teams">
    Designate counting teams with clear responsibilities.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### During counting

- Count each product carefully and completely
- Use barcode scanners to avoid entry errors
- Double-check high-value items
- Note any damaged or expired products separately
- Mark counted areas to avoid double-counting

### After counting

- Review all discrepancies before applying adjustments
- Investigate significant differences
- Document reasons for major variances
- Update inventory policies based on findings
- Generate count reports for management review

## Inventory count accuracy

To maintain accurate counts:

- Perform counts regularly (cycle counts)
- Train staff on proper counting procedures
- Use barcode scanning to minimize errors
- Investigate recurring discrepancies
- Review adjustment history for patterns
- Implement loss prevention measures

## Integration with stock adjustments

Physical counts automatically create stock adjustments with:

- **Adjustment type**: CORRECTION
- **Quantity change**: Difference between count and system
- **Reason**: "Physical count adjustment"
- **Employee**: Current logged-in user
- **Timestamp**: When the count was applied

These adjustments appear in the **Stock Adjustments** tab and may require manager approval depending on your settings.
