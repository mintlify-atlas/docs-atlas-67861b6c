Batch tracking allows you to manage inventory at a granular level by tracking individual batches of products with lot numbers, manufacturing dates, and expiration dates.

## Overview

The batch tracking system enables you to:

- Track products by supplier lot numbers
- Monitor manufacturing and expiration dates
- Identify batches by unique batch numbers
- View expiry status for each batch
- Manage product recalls by batch

## Adding product batches

To add a new product batch:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to inventory management">
    Access **Advanced Inventory Management** from the Manager dashboard.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select the Expiring Products tab">
    Click on the **Expiring Products** tab to access batch management.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Search for the product">
    Use the search field to find the product by name or barcode.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter batch details">
    Fill in the following information:
    - **Manufacturing date**: When the product was manufactured
    - **Expiry date**: When the product expires
    - **Supplier lot number**: The supplier's lot/batch identifier
    - **Quantity**: Number of units in this batch
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add the batch">
    Click **Add Batch** to create the batch record.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The system automatically generates a unique batch number in the format:
```
BATCH-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-XXX
```

For example: `BATCH-20260228-143052-742`

## Batch information

Each batch record contains:

- **Batch number**: Auto-generated unique identifier
- **Product**: The product this batch belongs to
- **Quantity**: Number of units in the batch
- **Supplier**: Source of the batch (defaults to "Manual Entry")
- **Lot number**: Supplier's lot number (optional)
- **Manufacturing date**: When the product was produced (optional)
- **Expiration date**: When the product expires (optional)
- **Received date**: When the batch was added to inventory
- **Cost per unit**: Cost for tracking purposes

## Expiry status tracking

Batches are automatically categorized by expiry status:

- **CRITICAL**: Expired or expires within 7 days (red badge)
- **WARNING**: Expires within 30 days (orange badge)
- **CAUTION**: Expires within 90 days (yellow badge)
- **GOOD**: More than 90 days until expiry (green badge)

## Managing expired batches

When a batch reaches CRITICAL status:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify the batch">
    Review batches with red CRITICAL badges in the Expiring Products tab.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Mark as expired">
    Click the **Mark as Expired** button on the batch card.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create adjustment">
    The system automatically populates a stock adjustment form with:
    - Adjustment type: EXPIRED
    - Quantity: Negative value matching batch quantity
    - Reason: "Expired batch: [batch-number]"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit adjustment">
    Review and submit the stock adjustment to remove the expired inventory.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Viewing batch details

In the **Expiring Products** tab, you can view:

- All product batches across your inventory
- Batch numbers and quantities
- Supplier information
- Expiration dates and days remaining
- Color-coded expiry status badges

## Batch tracking best practices

### For food and beverage

- Always enter expiration dates for perishable items
- Record supplier lot numbers for traceability
- Review CRITICAL batches daily
- Set up regular expiry checks

### For pharmaceuticals

- Track both manufacturing and expiration dates
- Maintain detailed lot numbers from suppliers
- Follow FIFO (First In, First Out) inventory rotation
- Document all expired batch removals

### For retail products

- Enter expiration dates for time-sensitive items
- Use batch numbers for warranty tracking
- Monitor seasonal product expiry
- Track batches for product recalls

## Batch reporting

Batch information is included in:

- Stock adjustment records
- Inventory count reports
- Expiration tracking reports
- Activity logs for audit trails

## API integration

Batches are managed through the REST API:

```javascript
// Add a batch
POST /products/:productId/batches
{
  batchNumber: "BATCH-20260228-143052-742",
  quantity: 100,
  costPerUnit: 5.00,
  receivedDate: "2026-02-28T14:30:52Z",
  expirationDate: "2026-12-31T00:00:00Z",
  manufacturingDate: "2026-02-01T00:00:00Z",
  supplier: "ABC Suppliers",
  lotNumber: "LOT-2024-XYZ"
}

// Get expiring batches
GET /products/expiring?days=365
```
